# Phase 33 Mocked Lead Inbox Contract

> Historical implementation contract for the first mocked GroupScout lead inbox.
> Phase 35 later defined the backend `GET /api/leads` contract, and the frontend repo now contains a dependency-free renderer/runtime. Use `UI_API_ENDPOINTS.md`, `UI_PHASE35_API_CONTRACT.md`, and `UI_TDD_PHASE_PLAN.md` for current live-vs-planned API status.

## Current Scope

Phase 33 defines the `/leads` route behavior after the Phase 32 app shell exists and before the Phase 35 live `/api/leads` contract existed.

Do not add production UI code that silently calls existing automation endpoints or reads the database. This historical contract required deterministic fixture data until the Phase 35 UI API contract is implemented on the current backend.

## Mock Data Boundary

The first frontend implementation must keep fixtures and UI data access behind a narrow boundary so a generated or typed `/api/leads` client can replace it later without rewriting the table.

| Boundary item | Required behavior | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Fixture source | Lead inbox data comes from local deterministic fixtures only. | Tests can switch between loading, populated, empty, and error fixtures without network calls. |
| Data adapter | The inbox route calls a local adapter such as `listLeadSummaries(params)` instead of importing fixture arrays directly in table components. | Replacing the adapter with a generated `/api/leads` client preserves component props and test coverage. |
| Query shape | Search, filters, sort, limit, and cursor-like fields are represented in typed params that mirror the planned `GET /api/leads` query. | No browser code references `POST /run`, `POST /n8n/webhook`, direct SQL, or server-only config. |
| Response shape | The fixture response mirrors `{items, next_cursor, total_estimate?, filters}` from `UI_API_ENDPOINTS.md`. | Empty and error responses use the same boundary as populated responses. |
| Static safety | Browser-visible code uses relative `/api/*` paths only when a live client is later introduced. | Static asset scans fail on `API_TOKEN`, database URLs, Slack/email/LLM keys, session secrets, or real `.env` values. |

## Lead Summary Fixture Shape

Fixtures should include the fields needed to test dense lead triage while staying compatible with the planned `lead_summary` response.

| Field | Required in mocked inbox | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | Stable link target for `/leads/:leadId`; use deterministic fake IDs. |
| `title` | Yes | Primary row label and search target. |
| `source` | Yes | Filter and source badge. |
| `source_url` or `audit_source_url` | Yes when available | Search target and evidence indicator; do not load raw payloads. |
| `status` | Yes | Commercial workflow state such as `new`, `notified`, `claimed`, `contacted`, `snoozed`, `flagged`, `dismissed`, `won`, `lost`, or `no_response`. |
| `priority_score` | Yes | Sortable score column and score band badge. |
| `priority_reason` | Recommended | Tooltip or detail-ready metadata; not required as a visible table column. |
| `owner` | Yes, nullable | Use `Unassigned` or an explicit empty owner state in UI copy. Historical note: Phase 36 later persisted this field. |
| `verification_state` | Yes | Separate from `status`; examples: `unverified`, `source_backed`, `missing_evidence`, `weak_confidence`, `contradiction`, `review_requested`. |
| `created_at` | Yes | Sortable created-date column. |
| `suggested_outreach_timing` | Yes | Timing column for outreach urgency. |
| `location` | Recommended | Search and property-fit display. |
| `project_type` | Recommended | Segment/type label. |
| `estimated_crew_size` | Recommended | Supports later value and room-night cues. |
| `estimated_duration_months` | Recommended | Supports timing and room-night cues. |
| `has_raw` | Yes | Indicates whether raw audit evidence exists without loading it. |

Fixture data must include at least:

- one high-score unassigned new lead;
- one claimed lead with an owner;
- one lead with missing evidence;
- one lead with weak confidence;
- one lead with a contradiction state;
- one lower-score or dismissed lead for filtering and sorting contrast;
- one source URL or note value that proves search reaches non-title fields.

## Table Contract

The lead inbox is table-first. It must not degrade into a marketing page, hero section, or decorative card grid.

| Column | Required behavior | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Score | Sortable numeric column with a text score or score band. | Operators can sort ascending and descending; color is not the only score cue. |
| Lead | Title plus compact secondary metadata such as segment/type or location. | Title is keyboard reachable through row selection or an explicit detail link. |
| Status | Commercial workflow status. | Status text or icon/shape distinguishes states; not color alone. |
| Source | Source badge or text plus evidence availability. | Source filter values match source labels. |
| Owner | Owner name or unassigned state. | Unassigned is explicit and searchable/filterable where the control supports owner. |
| Verification | Verification state separate from commercial status. | Missing evidence, weak confidence, and contradiction states are visible by default. |
| Created | Sortable created date. | Uses stable test data and deterministic formatting. |
| Timing | Suggested outreach timing or urgency. | Empty timing is represented intentionally, not by a blank ambiguous cell. |
| Row actions | Link to detail and future action capacity. | Actions have accessible names and do not require live backend mutations. |

Default ordering should put urgent, unowned, high-score leads before lower-score, owned, dismissed, or stale leads. Tests must define the exact deterministic order for the fixture set.

## Interaction Contract

| Interaction | Required behavior | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Loading state | Route shows shell, table skeleton or loading rows, and disabled controls where appropriate. | Loading does not remove navigation, heading, filter labels, or table region. |
| Populated state | Fixtures render all required columns and row counts. | Every visible cell is derived from typed fixture fields or documented display defaults. |
| Empty state | Empty fixture response shows a compact operational empty state. | Empty state preserves filters and offers clear reset behavior without claiming live API success. |
| Error state | Error fixture response shows a recoverable table-level error. | Error copy identifies the inbox data boundary and keeps the shell usable. |
| Search | Search covers title, organization/contact fields where present, location, source URL, notes, and source label. | Search is case-insensitive and deterministic in tests. |
| Status filter | Filters by commercial workflow state. | Verification state is not conflated with status. |
| Source filter | Filters by source. | Filter options come from fixture metadata or a typed constant, not hard-coded unrelated labels. |
| Owner filter | Filters assigned and unassigned leads. | Unassigned remains an explicit selectable state. |
| Verification filter | Filters verification states. | Missing evidence, weak confidence, and contradiction states are test-covered. |
| Minimum score filter | Filters by score threshold. | Boundary values are tested. |
| Created date filter | Filters by created date or date band. | Date comparisons use deterministic fixture dates. |
| Sorting | Supports score, created date, status, source, owner, verification, and timing where practical. | Sort controls expose `aria-sort` or equivalent selected-sort state. |
| Row selection | Pointer and keyboard selection preserve selected row state. | Selected state is visible and exposed with text/state, not color alone. |
| Reset filters | Clears search, filters, and sort to the default inbox view. | Reset is keyboard reachable and has an accessible name. |

## Accessibility Contract

The first frontend implementation must add failing tests for:

| Area | Required test coverage |
|---|---|
| Landmarks | `/leads` renders inside the Phase 32 operator shell with one main landmark and an accessible lead inbox region. |
| Table semantics | Header cells, sortable headers, row headers or detail links, row selection, loading, empty, and error states use accessible semantics. |
| Filter controls | Search input, selects, segmented controls, and date/score controls have labels, selected states, and keyboard interaction. |
| Keyboard path | Operators can tab through search, filters, sort headers, rows, row actions, reset, and pagination or cursor controls. |
| Focus states | Every interactive control uses the Phase 31 visible focus treatment. |
| Status distinction | Status and verification badges include text or shape/icon labels and are distinguishable without color. |
| Responsive behavior | Narrow viewports keep filters, row labels, status, verification, and timing readable without horizontal page overlap. |

## Replaceable API Contract

Phase 33 must not implement the live `/api/leads` backend. It should prepare for Phase 35 by keeping the mocked adapter compatible with the planned endpoint.

| Future API concern | Phase 33 mocked behavior |
|---|---|
| Query params | Model `status`, `source`, `min_score`, `q`, `owner`, `verification`, `created`, `sort`, `direction`, `limit`, and `cursor` in typed params. |
| Response envelope | Use `items`, `next_cursor`, optional `total_estimate`, and `filters`. |
| Generated client | Keep table components independent from fetch details so a generated OpenAPI client can replace the fixture adapter. |
| Auth/session | Do not introduce browser-visible `API_TOKEN`. Future UI auth/session work must be explicit. |
| Raw audit | Do not load raw payload bodies in the inbox. Use `has_raw` and safe metadata only. |

## Static Asset Safety

When static assets exist, run a build-time scan equivalent to:

```bash
rg -n "API_TOKEN|DATABASE_URL|SLACK_WEBHOOK|SLACK_BOT_TOKEN|RESEND_API_KEY|CLAUDE_API_KEY|ANTHROPIC_API_KEY|GEMINI_API_KEY|OPENAI_API_KEY|OLLAMA_ENDPOINT|UI_SESSION_SECRET|postgres://|sqlite://|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._-]+" web/dist
```

The command should return no matches. If the frontend build directory is not `web/dist`, update the path but keep the same intent.

## Phase 33 Done Criteria

Phase 33 is complete for this repository when:

| Criterion | Current result |
|---|---|
| Failing-test requirements exist for table rendering, sorting, searching, filtering, loading, empty, and error states. | Covered by the table, interaction, and accessibility contracts above. |
| Mocked fixture-only behavior was required until `/api/leads` existed. | Covered by the current scope, mock data boundary, and replaceable API contract. |
| Required columns are specified. | Covered by the table contract: status, score, source, owner, verification, created date, and timing are required. |
| Keyboard navigation and accessible filter controls are specified. | Covered by the accessibility contract. |
| API boundary is replaceable with generated or typed clients. | Covered by the mock data boundary and replaceable API contract. |
| Current backend limitations are explicit. | Historical note: this was true before Phase 35. Current status lives in `UI_PHASE35_API_CONTRACT.md` and `UI_API_ENDPOINTS.md`. |
