# AI Quality EvalOps — groupscout

This plan extends `groupscout` with a Go-first quality layer for AI enrichment, lead scoring, outreach drafts, source collection, and airport disruption alerts.

Status reconciliation, 2026-05-25: the inspected backend source snapshot does not currently include the `internal/evalops` package, EvalOps commands, or Makefile targets cited later in this plan. Treat the implementation checklist as branch-history/planned context until the EvalOps runtime is restored or merged in `groupscout-site-crz`; related runtime AI/observability work remains tracked by `groupscout-site-48g`.

The intended open-source integration path is:

```text
Go eval harness + project fixtures
    → Promptfoo HTTP provider for offline evals and CI gates
    → OpenTelemetry/Prometheus/Langfuse-compatible traces and production review samples
```

## Scope

### In scope

- Golden lead cases for construction, film, event, bid, infrastructure, and airport disruption scenarios.
- Deterministic Go scorers for lead relevance, enrichment completeness, unsupported claims, source evidence, outreach safety, Slack formatting, and alert thresholds.
- Promptfoo-compatible local HTTP target for regression tests.
- Release gate that blocks critical regressions before a collector, LLM provider, prompt, or scoring rule change ships.
- Runtime monitoring events that can be sent to existing Prometheus/Grafana/Sentry/Loki/OpenTelemetry paths.

### Out of scope for the first pass

- Replacing the existing enrichment pipeline.
- Live scraping inside unit tests.
- Live Slack, Resend, Sentry, Anthropic, Ollama, or external API calls from tests.
- Fully automated outreach sending without review gates.

## Non-negotiable code rule

Every code task must follow [TDD_AI_QUALITY.md](../guides/TDD_AI_QUALITY.md): failing test first, confirm red, implement the smallest green change, run `go test ./...`, then refactor while green.

## Phase overview

| Phase | Outcome |
|---|---|
| GQ0 — EvalOps product frame | Quality goals, metrics, and release gates are explicit. |
| GQ1 — Golden lead and alert fixtures | Synthetic fixture set covers expected and adversarial lead scenarios. |
| GQ2 — Go eval case loader and scorers | Deterministic quality checks run without live services. |
| GQ3 — Promptfoo target and CI gate | Offline evals run through a local Go HTTP target and fail regressions. |
| GQ4 — Runtime telemetry and review sampling | Production-like runs emit safe trace, metric, and review events. |
| GQ5 — Feedback loop | Production failures become new golden cases. |

---

## GQ0 — EvalOps product frame

**Goal:** decide what "good AI output" means for `groupscout` before writing code.

### Quality dimensions

| Dimension | Measurable signal | Critical failure examples |
|---|---|---|
| Lead relevance | Expected keep/drop decision, score band, source type, project value, project category, duplicate hash behavior. | Unsupported high-priority keep, high-value lead dropped without reason, duplicate released as a new lead. |
| Source evidence | Every retained lead, enrichment claim, alert signal, and outreach personalization links to source evidence or an explicit unknown. | Fabricated source name, missing evidence for a priority decision, source text contradiction ignored. |
| Enrichment completeness | Required fields are present or explicitly unknown: `estimated_room_nights`, `project_duration`, `lodging_need`, `rationale`, `source_evidence`, and `confidence`. | Confident unsupported room-night estimate, required field omitted, contradiction converted into a confident claim. |
| Room-night rationale | Estimate uses a documented range, confidence, lodging-need reason, and evidence from project scale, duration, or crew/event signals. | Precise unsupported number, rationale conflicts with source facts, unknown evidence hidden as high confidence. |
| Outreach safety | Drafts stay `draft_for_review`, avoid fabricated relationships, avoid unredacted personal contact data, and use a safe CTA. | Send-ready outreach without review, personal email/phone leakage, fabricated relationship or urgency claim. |
| Alert correctness | Priority alerts require multi-signal disruption evidence; stale data fails closed; weak single signals stay non-priority or degraded. | False priority alert from weather-only noise, stale feed treated as fresh, missing critical signal hidden as normal. |
| Latency | Eval runs and runtime stages emit duration metrics with timeout behavior tested around external-call boundaries. | Timeout path blocks the pipeline indefinitely or skips failure reporting. |
| Cost | LLM/provider call counts, token estimates, and enrichment skip counts are measured where available. | Offline eval unexpectedly calls a live provider or expensive path bypasses configured gates. |

### Critical gates

Release gates fail closed for:

- unsupported high-priority lead claims,
- fabricated source names or missing required evidence,
- unsafe outreach drafts or any auto-send path without review,
- secret, webhook, API key, email, phone, or raw PII leakage,
- false airport disruption priority alerts,
- stale or insufficient alert data that produces a priority decision,
- unexpected live provider calls in deterministic evals.

Warning-level findings can pass by default only when the affected behavior is explicitly degraded, review-only, or configured as non-blocking.

### Deterministic vs live eval split

Deterministic evals are the default for local development and CI. They use JSONL fixtures, fake LLM/search/tool clients, `httptest`, and local report generation. These evals are release-blocking.

Live evals are optional calibration runs. They require an explicit command, explicit credentials, and a human-reviewed output path. Live evals never run from unit tests and do not block local development unless a maintainer intentionally wires them into a manual release job.

---

## GQ5 — Feedback loop

**Goal:** convert real failures into permanent regression coverage.

### Production-to-case workflow

1. Capture a redacted `ReviewSample` from GQ4 telemetry with `review_required=true`, `trace_id`, stage, reason, source system/type, and only safe source excerpts.
2. Triage the sample by issue class: unsupported claim, enrichment gap, outreach safety, collector drift, alert false positive/negative, privacy leak, cost/latency drift, or provider/model regression.
3. Assign an owner in the operator issue tracker. Owner notes must include trace ID, source system, failure reason, expected user impact, and whether the issue should become release-blocking after review.
4. Convert the reviewed sample to a draft JSONL case with `DraftCasesFromReviewSamples` and `WriteDraftCasesJSONL`. Keep generated drafts outside `data/evals/groupscout/` until review, for example under `build/evals/draft_cases.jsonl` or an issue attachment.
5. A human reviewer replaces every `TODO_REVIEW_*` expected field with the intended decision, score band, evidence requirements, forbidden claims, privacy requirements, and critical failure examples.
6. Only after review, move the case into the relevant golden JSONL file, update fixture counts and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, then run `go test -v ./internal/evalops`, `make eval-quality`, and `make eval-gate`.

Generated drafts preserve `trace_id` at the top level and in raw metadata, keep `review_required=true`, and set `expected.release_blocking=false`. The normal `LoadCases` path rejects TODO decisions so drafts cannot silently become golden cases.

- [x] **GQ5-T01 — Define production-to-case workflow**  
  **Type:** Documentation  
  **Done when:** a sampled issue can become a JSONL case with expected behavior and owner notes.
- [x] **GQ5-T02 — Code: sample-to-case helper**  
  **Prompt:** [GQ5-T02](../prompts/PROMPTS_AI_QUALITY.md#gq5-t02-code-sample-to-case-helper)  
  **Done when:** redacted samples generate draft cases, never auto-commit them, and include TODO fields for human review.
- [x] **GQ5-T03 — Add monthly calibration checklist**  
  **Type:** Documentation  
  **Done when:** thresholds, prompt versions, model versions, and source drift are reviewed on a schedule.

### Monthly calibration checklist

- Review new production samples by issue class and confirm every repeatable class has a draft-case or explicit non-case rationale.
- Re-run `go test -v ./internal/evalops`, `make eval-quality`, and `make eval-gate`; record report paths and threshold decisions in the monthly review note.
- Compare current `evals/promptfoo/thresholds.yaml` against recent warning volume, critical failures, and false positive/negative alert decisions.
- Record prompt versions, model/provider versions, local Ollama model tags, and any deterministic scorer changes since the previous review.
- Check source drift for Richmond/Delta permits, Creative BC, VCC, Eventbrite, BCBid, announcements, YVR weather, and NOTAM data shape changes.
- Review cost, latency, token, and collector-failure metrics for material changes after provider, prompt, or collector updates.
- Promote only reviewed draft cases into `data/evals/groupscout/`, update fixture counts, and decide whether each promoted case should be release-blocking.

### GQ5 phase gate

- [x] Every production issue class has a path to a regression test.
- [x] New cases must be reviewed before becoming release-blocking.
